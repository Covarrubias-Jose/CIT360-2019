 * * Thread Class vs Runnable Interface
 *
 * "1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class 
 * because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the
 * Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
 *
 * 2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class 
 * because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. 
 * that are not available in Runnable interface."
